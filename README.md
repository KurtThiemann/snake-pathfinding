# snake-pathfinding
Like Snake, but you don't have to play yourself.

This project was created as part of the IT-Sommerfest at [Hochschule Zittau/GÃ¶rlitz](https://www.hszg.de/). It implements a simple pathfinding algorithm into the well known mobile game Snake. Maybe one day I'll add a proper README...
